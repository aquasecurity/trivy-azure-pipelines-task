# This workflow is triggered manually to publish a dev version of the extension
# to the Azure DevOps Marketplace. It is used for testing and development purposes.
# The version is specified as a parameter, and the publisher name can be overridden.
# The extension is shared with the specified Azure DevOps organization(s).
# The workflow also extracts the extension files and uploads them as a GitHub Pages artifact
# to have access to the private's extension files in Azure Pipelines.
# GitHub Pages should be enabled for the repository with GitHub Actions as the source.
